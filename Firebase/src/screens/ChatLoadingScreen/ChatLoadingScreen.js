How I want this to work for now:
    1. Bob requests to chat with Alice
    2. Bob's App waits for a similar request from Alice
    3. Upon receiving her request, they are both moved into the chat window, which ends when one of them exits.

    Functionality to implement later: //Look into Firebase functions for some of these things.
        1. Asynchronous chatting - Alice and Bob can chat when the other isn't online
        2. Chat invitations - some sort of screen popup upon login? - definitely look into this
        3. Forced redirect to chat window - Alice requests to chat, Bob takes a while to respond to invitation. 
                                            - when he does, the chat screen opens for both of them

    Possible procedure (this may allow for asynchronous chatting):
        1. Bob requests to chat. This request is stored in a request document
        2. Alice's app checks if someone wants to chat in the useEffect loop 
            2a. This is stored in a request collection that contains the user sending the request and the intended recipient.
            2b. If she accepts, it creates a new conversation.

   The next useEffect() loop is a workaround to an issue I was having. I wanted to invite people by email address
   instead of userName (because I don't have userNames in this code), and so before creating the invite, I wanted to 
   check that it was valid. However, that code reads data from a server, which is asynchronous. So, I created a useEffect loop 
   just for it. 

   Another solution would probably be to return a promise from checkEmail and have that resolve in the onCreateInviteButtonPress 
   function. I'll work on implementing that later. It would have the advantage of not fetching data every keystroke. The free plan
   only allows us 50000 reads a day.

            Erroneous Behavior:

                    2b. The two conversations rendered don't show up in the database though. 
                    3b. Looping thru the conversationRef arr one more time creates another conversation box.
                2. The chatloadingscreen immediately redirects to the chatscreen, throwing the alert "something was pressed" twice

                4. Returning to the chatloading screen again works.

                RESOLVED part 1: The issue was that the [...prev, oldConversations] line in the first useEffect loop added an empty array to the conversations array.
                         Changing it to [...prev, ...oldConversations] seems to have done the trick.
